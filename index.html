                <h3>Arts</h3>
                <p>
                    I have always been interested in trying anything new that is artistic. Whether that be drawing, painting, 
                    scrapbooking, crocheting, knitting…. You name it! I am not in any means the best at any of these hobbies 
                    that I have picked up, but I love learning new things and watching my creations come to life! I think that 
                    what I like about art is having some foundational rules to guide you, like using certain stitch patterns or 
                    painting with certain colors that work well together, but also having the freedom of making it your own.

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    Music is such an important part of many people’s lives, including mine. In terms of genres, I enjoy many
                     different types of music. However, I am most into Bollywood and just generally all South Asian music. 
                     Although my 50+ hour playlists do not do it justice, because this kind of music is just so good! Being South Asian myself, 
                      listening to these songs started simply from the desire to be closer to and more appreciative of my culture. It has now 
                      turned into a genuine liking for all South Asian music.

                <h3>The Village</h3>
                <p>
                    My parents are immigrants from the South Asian country Bangladesh. This leads me to having many family 
                    members to visit back home whenever I go. The summer of 2023 was my last visit, and it was a very hot yet 
                    exciting time. Being from the village in Bangladesh, the culture shock is quite large. They do not eat the 
                    same foods or spend their time doing the same activities. A different environment, isolated from what I am 
                    used to in the western world, is very liberating. I enjoyed things like street food, seeing the infamous tea 
                    plants (shown as the banner of this website), the personal ponds (closest thing to backyard swimming pools 
                    in the village), and the endless shopping for cultural clothes. I can go on about the beauties of Bangladesh,
                    but I will stop there. The following images are only some of what I could capture of the life where my parents are from:

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>The best thing that I can say about myself is that I am a very quick learner. Not only that, 
                but I love learning and creating new things of my own. I can adapt to different environments 
                and am quick to appreciate what there is to gain from every situation, even if there are many downsides. 
                <br>
                <br>
                On a more technical note, I am proficient in HTML and CSS. This is what was used 
                to make this very website! Python is one of my favorite programming languages so far, 
                but I am in the process of learning more languages so that may very well change. My <a href="https://github.com/SunandaD1" 
                target="_blank"><b>Github</b></a> shows some 
                of the projects completed using Python. As mentioned,
                 I am a quick learner and am always wanting to learn new things to implement them into my own 
                 creations, so my current goal is to continue learning and hopefully mastering more technical 
                 skills as I continue my studies as a Software Engineering student.
